# Explainable-AI
Explainable AI is a machine learning project focused on building transparent, interpretable, and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems. The project integrates modern explainability techniques such as LIME, SHAP, and attention-based explanations to help users understand how and why AI models make decisions.


# Explainable AI (XAI)

## 📖 Overview

Explainable AI (XAI) focuses on making machine learning models transparent, interpretable, and trustworthy. Unlike traditional black-box models, XAI techniques help users understand **why** a model made a specific prediction, which is especially important in high-impact domains such as healthcare, finance, and decision support systems.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Explainable AI methods while maintaining strong predictive performance.
